# which contains other examples of configuration which can be placed in this file
# but new users likely don't need any of them initially.

# Package Management configuration
#
# This variable lists which packaging formats to enable. Multiple package backends
# can be enabled at once and the first item listed in the variable will be used
# to generate the root filesystems.
# Options are:
#  - 'package_deb' for debian style deb files
#  - 'package_ipk' for ipk files are used by opkg (a debian style embedded package manager)
#  - 'package_rpm' for rpm style packages

#
# Extra image configuration defaults
#
# The EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES variable allows extra packages to be added to the generated
# images. Some of these options are added to certain image types automatically. Some
# of the features available are:
#  "dbg-pkgs"             - add -dbg packages for all installed packages
#                           (adds symbol information for debugging/profiling)
#  "src-pkgs"             - add -src packages for all installed packages
#                           (adds source code for debugging)
#  "dev-pkgs"             - add -dev packages for all installed packages
#                           (useful if you want to develop against libs in the image)
#  "ptest-pkgs"           - add -ptest packages for all ptest-enabled packages
#                           (useful if you want to run the package test suites)
#  "tools-sdk"            - add development tools (gcc, make, pkgconfig etc.)
#  "tools-debug"          - add debugging tools (gdb, strace)
#  "eclipse-debug"        - add Eclipse remote debugging support
#  "tools-profile"        - add profiling tools (oprofile, lttng, valgrind)
#  "tools-testapps"       - add useful testing tools (ts_print, aplay, arecord etc.)
#  "allow-empty-password" - allow users to have an empty password
#  "empty-root-password"  - the root user has no password set
#  "allow-root-login      - the root user can login
# There are other features that can be used here too, see
# meta/classes-recipe/image.bbclass and
# meta/classes-recipe/core-image.bbclass for more details.
